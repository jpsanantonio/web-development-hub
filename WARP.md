# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project type: Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4, deployed as a static export to Cloudflare Workers.

Commands
- Setup
  - fnm use
  - pnpm install
- Develop
  - pnpm dev  # Next dev with Turbopack
- Build
  - pnpm build  # static export to out/
- Lint
  - pnpm lint
- Cloudflare (Workers static assets)
  - pnpm preview  # Build and serve out/ locally via wrangler dev
  - pnpm deploy   # Build and deploy out/ to Cloudflare Workers
  - pnpm upload   # Build and upload a new version (without switching traffic)
  - pnpm cf-typegen  # Generate Cloudflare env types (wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareEnv)
- Tests
  - pnpm test       # Vitest: data integrity, contexts, hooks
  - pnpm test:watch # Vitest in watch mode
  - pnpm test:e2e   # Playwright against out/ served by wrangler dev
  - pnpm typecheck  # tsc --noEmit

Environment notes
- Node: engines requires 22.x, matching .node-version. Use fnm use to select it.
- Package manager: pnpm is used exclusively (see README and CLAUDE.md).

High-level architecture and structure
- App Router entry and global layout
  - app/layout.tsx is the root layout: sets fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono), global SEO metadata, viewport, and wraps the app with providers.
  - Providers used globally:
    - ThemeProvider (contexts/theme-context.tsx): toggles light/dark theme, persists to localStorage, applies the `dark` class to documentElement.
    - BookmarksProvider (contexts/bookmarks-context.tsx): manages a list of bookmarked resources, persisted to localStorage. Only fields that cannot be re-derived are stored; icons are resolved from the title wherever a card renders.
  - ServiceWorkerRegistration (components/service-worker-registration.tsx) is mounted in layout to register public/sw.js and prompt for updates.
  - LayoutWrapper (components/ui/layout-wrapper.tsx): wraps page content with SearchProvider and the persistent navigation chrome.

- Navigation, search, and filtering
  - Search context lives in contexts/search-context.tsx and is provided by LayoutWrapper. It:
    - Builds a flat resource index from constants/sections.ts.
    - Supports free-text search across title/description/section and tag filtering via hooks/useFilter.ts.
    - Tracks a filter panel state and current category; resets on route change.
  - SearchWrapper (components/search-wrapper.tsx) conditionally renders grouped search results by section when a query or tags are active; otherwise renders children (the normal page).
  - lib/utils/navigation.ts computes the section nav model and helpers (DEFAULT_NAV_ITEMS, createSearchNavItems, scrollToSection) used by the desktop/mobile navigation components.
  - Navigation UI:
    - components/ui/navigation/desktop-navigation.tsx and mobile-navigation.tsx render the section list and quick actions (home, bookmarks, theme toggle). They consume ThemeProvider and BookmarksProvider.
    - components/ui/navigation-item.tsx renders individual nav items.

- Data model and content
  - The primary content comes from constants/sections.ts: a curated list of resources grouped into top-level sections. Each resource has title, href, description, and optional tags.
  - lib/data/resource-mappings.ts maps resource titles to icon identifiers. The title-to-section lookup beside it is derived from constants/sections.ts rather than hand-listed.
  - lib/types.ts defines CategoryType used in app/page.tsx and routes.

- Pages and composition
  - app/page.tsx builds the home view using SECTIONS-derived data and re-usable components (e.g., ResourceCard, ResourceGrid). Individual category pages live under app/<category>/page.tsx and follow the same data source.
  - Shared UI lives under components/ui/ (e.g., hero-banner, resource-card, inputs, navigation components). Styling leverages Tailwind and small utilities in lib/utils.ts (cn helper). Additional UI behavior helpers exist in lib/utils/resource-card.ts and lib/hooks/*.

- Styling and assets
  - Tailwind CSS v4 is enabled via @tailwindcss/postcss (postcss.config.mjs). Global styles are in app/globals.css with CSS variables for theme tokens.
  - Images and PWA assets live in public/ (including public/sw.js and public/offline.html).

- Performance and deployment configuration
  - next.config.mjs:
    - output: 'export' — the whole app prerenders, so the build emits static files to out/.
    - experimental.optimizePackageImports for @iconify/react.
    - Images unoptimized (nothing imports next/image); SVG allowed with CSP sandboxing.
  - public/_headers carries the caching and security headers; Cloudflare Workers
    parses it natively, and next.config's headers() is a no-op under static export.
  - wrangler.jsonc declares assets only and no main, so no Worker script is deployed.
    It also pins preview_urls: true, which the per-branch previews depend on -
    wrangler otherwise defaults it to the value of workers_dev.
  - Cloudflare Workers Builds is connected to the repository and does the
    deploying: main goes to webdevhub.link, other branches are uploaded as Worker
    versions and their preview URLs are commented on the pull request. The build
    command is dashboard state; the Worker config itself stays in wrangler.jsonc.
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml deploys nothing - it runs lint, typecheck, Vitest and
    the Playwright suite. Workers Builds runs none of those, so CI is the only
    gate on what ships.

Assistant-specific notes from CLAUDE.md (applicable here)
- Use pnpm for all package operations.
- The architecture relies on App Router, context providers (Theme, Bookmarks, Search), Tailwind v4, and shadcn/Radix-based components.
